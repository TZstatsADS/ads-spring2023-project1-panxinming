### [Project Description](doc/)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) project this semester. 

Term: Spring 2023

+ Projec title: How to Speak Like Philosopher
+ This project is conducted by [Xinming Pan]

+ Project summary: Philosophy may be abstract to someone, so can we speak like philosophers? The answer is **Yes**. We don't need to learn what is philosophy and the background. We just need to do the `EDA` to analyze how philosophers speak. What's more, we are going to use a more advanced technology method, Markov Model, to simulate the sentence of philosophers. Finally, we can become a 'true' philosopher.
